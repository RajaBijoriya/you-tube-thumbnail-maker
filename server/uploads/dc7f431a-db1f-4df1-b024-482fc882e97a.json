The primary image should be placed on the right side of the frame. The image should be a colorful, high-quality illustration or photo that reflects the topic of the video. Overlay the image with bold, easy-to-read text on the left side, ensuring the text stands out against the background. Make sure the text's font and size are consistent with the playful theme. Ensure the thumbnail is filled with vibrant colors, crisp lines, and clear elements to make it more engaging.","styleGuide":"The style of the thumbnail should be colorful and playful, fostering a sense of curiosity and fun. Use bold, vibrant colors and playful fonts. Avoid overly complex designs or cluttered elements that might distract the viewer. Balance the composition with a clear hierarchy of visual elements, guiding the viewer's eyes from the main image to the title and other text elements.","colorPalette":"Opt for a bright, vibrant color palette to match the playful mood of the video. Use contrasting colors to ensure the text stands out against the image. Consider using colors such as bright yellow, cyan, magenta, or lime green.","composition":"The composition should follow the 'rule of thirds' to create a balanced thumbnail. Position the main image on the right third of the frame. Place the title and any additional text on the left side, allowing it to cover the middle to left third of the frame. Balance the bright colors of the image and text with some neutral space to prevent the thumbnail from being overwhelming."},"promptVariations":["Design an informative YouTube thumbnail that exudes a fun and lively ambiance. Position the main image to dominate the right side of the layout. The image can either be a vivid, high-resolution illustration or a lively picture relevant to the video's content. To the left side, superimpose oversized, legible text that contrasts well with the background. Maintain the font style and size in line with the playful atmosphere. Compose the thumbnail with a palette of radiant hues, sharp edges, and well-defined objects to enhance its allure."],"thumbnails":[],"generatedAt":"2025-08-31T03:41:01.666Z"}
