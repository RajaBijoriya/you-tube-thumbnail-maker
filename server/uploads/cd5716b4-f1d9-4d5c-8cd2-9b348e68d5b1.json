On the right side of the thumbnail, place a high-resolution, vivid image related to the educational topic. The image should evoke a sense of inspiration and curiosity. On the left, include text that is easy to read, even at smaller sizes, highlighting the video's title or key points in a bold, compelling font. Include a small icon or logo representing the channel or the educational nature of the content in the bottom left corner. Ensure the overall design is clean and professional, with a clear focal point that draws the viewer's attention.","styleGuide":"The style should be colorful, modern, and professional, maintaining a balance between being visually striking and not too cluttered. Use bold, easy-to-read fonts for any text. The image used should be high-quality, relevant to the educational content, and give off a motivational vibe. Light should be well distributed throughout the image, with no dark or excessively bright spots that could distract the viewer. All elements should be well-defined, with the image and the text complementing each other.","colorPalette":"Use a bright and vibrant color palette to attract attention and reflect the educational and motivational mood. Opt for primary and secondary colors, such as blues, yellows, and greens, that are commonly associated with education and learning. Make sure the text color contrasts well with the background for easy readability.","composition":"The composition should be balanced, with the photo placement on the right and the text on the left. The image should occupy about 60% of the thumbnail, while the text and logo take up the remaining 40%. This layout should be adaptable to both horizontal (1280x720) and vertical (1080x1920) formats. The viewer's eyes should naturally be drawn to the image first, then move to the text."},"promptVariations":["Create a motivational YouTube thumbnail that has an educational theme.
